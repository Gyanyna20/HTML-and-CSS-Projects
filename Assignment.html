		<h3>Intresting facts about cactus</h3>
		<p>
		Cacti can store large amounts of water in their stems, allowing them to survive months (sometimes years!) without rain.<br />
		Their spines are actually modified leaves, which help reduce water loss and protect them from animals.<br />
		Some cacti produce huge, beautiful flowers that bloom only at night and last just a few hours.<br />
		Cacti don’t all live in deserts—some species grow in rainforests and mountains.<br />
		The tallest cactus, the saguaro, can grow over 40 feet (12 meters) tall and live for more than 150 years.<br />
		Cacti use a special process called CAM photosynthesis, opening their pores at night to save water.<br />
		Certain cacti, like prickly pear, are edible and used in food, medicine, and cosmetics.<br />
